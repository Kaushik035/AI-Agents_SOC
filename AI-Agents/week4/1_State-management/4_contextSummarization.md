# ðŸ§  Context Summarization Techniques

## âœ… What are Context Summarization Techniques?

Context summarization condenses long conversation history into a short, meaningful summary. This helps fit within token limits while preserving the **essential meaning**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Itâ€™s Important

| Feature       | Benefit                                                   |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Efficiency** | Reduces token count for faster and cheaper API calls       |
| **Clarity**    | Focuses model on relevant information                      |
| **Scalability**| Makes long conversations manageable                        |
| **Coherence**  | Improves quality of responses in multi-turn conversations |

## ðŸ”§ How to Implement

### 1. **Abstractive Summarization**
Use OpenAI (or another LLM) to generate a human-like summary from raw dialogue.

### 2. **Selective Inclusion**
Include only the most important messages (e.g., based on position or keywords).

### 3. **Prompt Design**
Frame your summarization instruction clearly and concisely.

## ðŸ§ª Example Code â€“ Abstractive Summarization with OpenAI

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Sample conversation history
conversation_history = []

def add_to_history(role, content):
    conversation_history.append({"role": role, "content": content})

def estimate_tokens(text):
    """Rough estimation: 1 token â‰ˆ 4 characters."""
    return len(text) // 4

def call_openai(prompt, context):
    """Mock API call â€” replace with OpenAI API."""
    print("\n--- OpenAI Request ---")
    print(prompt)
    return "Summarized response: Machine learning is an AI technique that finds patterns."

def summarize_context():
    """Summarize conversation history using OpenAI."""
    full_context = " ".join([msg["content"] for msg in conversation_history])

    if estimate_tokens(full_context) < 50:
        return full_context

    summary_prompt = f"Summarize the following conversation concisely:\n{full_context}"
    summary_context = [{"role": "user", "content": summary_prompt}]
    summary = call_openai(summary_prompt, summary_context)
    return summary

add_to_history("user", "What is machine learning?")
add_to_history("assistant", "Machine learning is a subset of AI.")
add_to_history("user", "How does it work?")
add_to_history("assistant", "It uses algorithms to find patterns.")

summary = summarize_context()
print(summary)
```

## What gets sent to OpenAI

Summarize the following conversation concisely:
What is machine learning? Machine learning is a subset of AI. How does it work? It uses algorithms to

## Expected Output

Summarized response: Machine learning uses algorithms to find patterns.
