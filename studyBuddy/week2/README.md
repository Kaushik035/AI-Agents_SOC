# Steps for assignment 2.1

This project demonstrates a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built using:
- `SentenceTransformers` to create text embeddings
- `FAISS` for fast similarity-based retrieval
- `OpenAI` for answering questions based only on retrieved chunks from study notes

The chatbot answers finance-related questions **based only on your provided notes** (`my_notes.md`) using a controlled prompt.

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2. Create an .env file in the root directory and add your proxy URL to the .env file:

> PROXY_URL=https://socapi.deepaksilaych.me/student1


(Run the 3rd command only if you haven't used earlier, if you used earlier you should be able to see a folder named 'shared' in your root directory)
### 3. Install the shared package in editable mode:(This makes the shared/ module directly available to your scriptâ€”no need for PYTHONPATH)

> pip install -e .

### 4. From the project root, run it:

> python studyBuddy/week2/Assignment2.1/rag_openAI_chatbot.py (can directly run using the Run button in vs code)
